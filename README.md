📋 How to Play
The game is played on a 3×3 grid.

One player is "X", and the other is "O".

Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.

If all 9 squares are filled and no one has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.

Click "Reset Game" to start a new round.

🧠 About the Game
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a timeless two-player game often played on paper. This digital version replicates that experience using simple web technologies while offering a smooth, interactive interface.
